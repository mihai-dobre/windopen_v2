
Windopen
------------------------

An application for indoor air quality management and much more.

Windopen is an application that started from the need of refreshing the air in the apartment during the night. Even though it has been started with this functionality in mind, during the development, it became more like a framework for controlling remotely or automatically different things. It is very modular, high scalable and secure. It can offer authentication at all levels.
Windopen is a client server application. Besides the user interaction, the server side supports web hooks. This way, Windopen can be controlled by other applications.
Windopen application was designed to be able to integrate with IFTTT application. I chose IFTTT because it supports a wide variety of interactions(with most of the IoT devices available on the market).
